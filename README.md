# Udacity-Memory-Game-Project
This is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration!)

## How to play:
The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

#### In each turn:
* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Dependencies:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* Font Awesome Icons
* Animate.css
* EasyTimer.js

The shuffle() function was provided in the starter code given by Udacity (from StackOverflow).
